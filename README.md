Stochastic_LV_ABCSMC.py : Runs the ABC-SMC Model Selection algorithm for Deterministic and Stochastic Lotka-Volterra 
                          (and Hopefully it will also us the Deterministic and Stochastic repressilator model)


SIR_ABCSMC.py: Runs the ABC-SMC Model Selection algorithm for the 4 different SIR Models mentioned in the paper.
